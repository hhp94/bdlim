#' Make orthonomal basis for weight functions

#' @param exposure Matrix of repeated measures of exposure that is n x T where n is the number of observations and T is the number of time points.
#' @param df Degrees of freedom (including intercept) for the natural spline basis to be used.
#'
#' @return A matrix with orthonormal basis expansions of exposure time. The matrix is T x df. These have the span of natural splines with an intercept and df degrees of freedom.
