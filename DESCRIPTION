Description: Estimation and interpretation of Bayesian distributed lag interaction models (BDLIMs). A BDLIM regresses a scalar outcome on repeated measures of exposure and allows for modification by a categorical variable under four specific patterns of modification. The main function is bdlim(). There are also summary and plotting files. Details on methodology are described in Wilson et al. (2017) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxx002>.
