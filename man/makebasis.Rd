\title{Make orthonomal basis for weight functions}
\usage{
makebasis(exposure, df)
}
\arguments{
\item{exposure}{Matrix of repeated measures of exposure that is n x T where n is the number of observations and T is the number of time points.}

\item{df}{Degrees of freedom (including intercept) for the natural spline basis to be used.}
}
\value{
A matrix with orthonormal basis expansions of exposure time. The matrix is T x df. These have the span of natural splines with an intercept and df degrees of freedom.
}

\examples{
B <- makebasis(sbd_bdlim[, paste0("pm25_", 1:37)], df = 4)
}
